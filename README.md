This is a script/associated bat file that will run PokeRandoZX's randomizer with a requirements file that I saved after creating my run's rules. You can find information about this tool [here](https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-pokemon-randomizer-zx/releases).

This script also opens the game, runs through the intro dialogue and autonames your character and rival. I couldn't think of a better way to iterate through the menu, but it's current set to "Sai" and "Intense". The script also opens and sets the settings that I prefer to use.

I have not included the .gba file, I don't feel like dealing with Nintendo's legal team.
